# Ladder

Ladder tournament ranking website. Uses Glicko2 to rank players of pool, foosball, or any other 1 vs 1 game and track their skill over time.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install gems.
```
git clone https://github.com/proglottis/ladder.git
cd ladder
bundle install
```

Create `config/application.yml` from the example file `config/application.yml.example`. If you are only running ladder locally these values can be left at their defaults.

Create `config/database.yml` from the example file `config/database.yml.example`.

Setup the database. _Do not run migrations from the start of time, doing so will fail._
```
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

For development the "developer" strategy is enabled on OmniAuth. This will accept any values for authentication.
